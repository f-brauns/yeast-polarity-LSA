This is a code repository for the paper entitled "Adaptability and evolution of the cell polarization ma-chinery in budding yeast" by Fridtjof Brauns, Leila M. Iñigo de la Cruz, Werner K.-G. Daalman, Ilse de Bruin, Jacob Halatek, Liedewij Laan and Erwin Frey https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.290510

## Content

Mathematica notebooks for Linear Stability Analysis (LSA) in spherical geometry and parameter filtering. For background information, see the Supplementary Information of the paper. Precomputed data and raw plots are included in the Data and Export directories.

COMSOL Multiphysics simulation setup files for reaction–diffusion dynamics in spherical geometry (mimicking a yeast cell) with bulk-surface coupling. Running the simulations requires COMSOL v6.0 or later. Different files correspond to different mutant conditions with parameters as specified in the Supplementary Information of the paper.
